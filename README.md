# Chat App using Chatengine and Firebase
The project aims to provide a platform where users can send and receive messages in real time. Users should be able to create chat rooms, join existing ones, and exchange messages with other users in the same room. The backend services will be hosted on Firebase, and users will authenticate with their Google accounts.
